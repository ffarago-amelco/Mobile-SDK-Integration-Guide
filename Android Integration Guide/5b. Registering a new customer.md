# Registering a new customer

## When to register a new customer
- Upon account creation
- Newsletter signup
- Guest checkout

## Use either setUserId() OR registerUser() functions
Once the user succesfully creates an account, they become an recognized customer. 
As soon as this happens for each individual user, call only one of the functions below:

- `setUserId()` function and pass the `SDKID` when an **"email address" is not** available:
```java
// Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known PublicCustomerId
Optimove.getInstance().setUserId("<YOUR_CUSTOMERS_SDK_ID>");
```

- `registerUser()` function and pass the `SDKID` when an **"email address" is** available:
```java
// Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known PublicCustomerId
Optimove.getInstance().registerUser("<YOUR_CUSTOMERS_SDK_ID>", "<YOUR_CUSTOMERS_EMAIL_ADDRESS>", "event_name", {parameter object});
```
>**Note:** You must request from Optimove Product Integration team to create an event and parameters in this case, otherwise you will see errors.
