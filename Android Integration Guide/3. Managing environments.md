# Managing Environments - During Integration Only

## Enabling the Staging Environment
You have the ability to manage multiple application environments and send your SDK log details to Optimove during the integration phase. To do so, add a flag to mark the specific `BuildType`s/`BuildFlavor`s that represent the app's _Staging_ environment:

**Sample Code Snippet**
```groovy
// Add this only for the BuildTypes that are considered "Staging"
buildConfigField "Boolean", "OPTIMOVE_CLIENT_STG_ENV", "true"
// Default value is "false"
```

The above should only be enabled for `BuildType`s that are in _Staging_ and not your development environment.

The SDK considers a _Staging_ environment one that is safe to collect more metrics about the SDK's performance, disregarding battery/data use conservation. 

## Configuring Log Levels
By default, the Optimove Android SDK will report any log event, from INFO level and above, except for when the app is in production, at which time the log level is set to WARN and above. With this feature, you may optionaly change the log level to one you see fit for your enviroment.

Optimove supports log levels by adding the optional flag `OPTIMOVE_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` in the `BuildConfig` of the app. The Optimove Android SDK will use this flag to set the minimum log reporting level. You should use this during your development/testing stages, if relevant for your app.

Possible values are: `debug`, `warn`, `error` (case insenstive)

**Sample Log Level Code Snippet**
```groovy
buildConfigField "String", "OPTIMOVE_MIN_LOG_LEVEL", "warn"
```
