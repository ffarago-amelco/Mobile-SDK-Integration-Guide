# Managing Android Environments

## Enabling Staging Environment
Optimove has added the ability to manage multiple application environments and send your SDK log details to Optimove during integration phase.

Added a flag to mark the specific `BuildType`s/`BuildFlavor`s that represent the app's _Staging_ environment

**Code Snippet Example**
```groovy
// Add this only for the BuildTypes that are considered "Staging"
buildConfigField "Boolean", "OPTIMOVE_CLIENT_STG_ENV", 'true' 
// Default value is "false"
```

> The SDK considers a _Staging_ environment one that is:
> - Safe to collect more metrics about the SDK's performance, disregarding battery/data use conservation
> - This should only be enabled for `BuildType`s that is in _Staging_ and not your development environment

## Configurating Log Levels
Use this during your development/testing stages.
By default we will report any log from INFO level and above, except for when the app is in production, where we set it to WARN and above. With this feature they can optionaly change the levels to ones they see fit to their enviroments. This should really only be in use for apps that care about controling these sort of things
- Optimove supports log levels by adding the optional flag  `OPTIMOVE_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` in the `BuildConfig` of the app. Optimove SDK would use the flag to set the minimal reported Log Level. 
- Possible values are:  _debug/warn/error_ (case insenstive)

**Log Level Code Snippet Example**
```groovy
buildConfigField "String", "OPTIMOVE_MIN_LOG_LEVEL", '"<debug/warn/error>"'    
```
