# Recognizing a returning customer

Once the user succesfully logs in to your app, they become an recognized customer. 
As soon as this happens for each individual user, call the `setUserId()` function and pass the `SDKID`:

```java
// Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known PublicCustomerId
Optimove.getInstance().setUserId("<YOUR_CUSTOMERS_SDK_ID>");
```
