# Android Dependencies & Prerequisites


## Versioning
Optimove uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), which means that you should automatically update your Optimove SDK every time we release a patch or a minor release.

- Latest Optimove major version 2.+

## Support SDK Language

- Optimove's Android SDK is written in `Java 8`
>For more information about _Android Official Java 8 Support_ checkout [this Developer's Guide](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/java8-support) article

- Hosting apps that are written in `Java 7` or use `Jack` some build errors may occur. In that case migrate the app to `Java 8`. 

- Optimove SDK is compatible with both AppCompat and AndroidX

// Meytal - This should be moved to the "Initializing Optimove Android SDK" doc. It's a step between 3 and 4 that is only valid if the client's app is written in Kotlin.
- Kotlin: Since Kotlin is completely interoperable with Java Apps that are written in Kotlin can use the SDK. However, these apps should add the formentioned `compileOptions` and also following object below:
  ```groovy
  kotlinOptions {
      jvmTarget = '1.8'
  }
  ```
  If you get an error like `:app:transformClassesWithDesugarForDebug`, you may have to enable desugaring in your `gradle.properties` file:
  ```groovy
  android.enableD8.desugaring = true
  ```

## Prerequisites
Send the follow details to Optimove Product Integration team in order to receive your Optimove Mobile SDK configuration details.

- **App's package(s)** - If you are using multiple apps for development/testing purposes, please provide a list of all package names being used for all environments
// Meytal - I've removed the SHA key prerequ as we don't use it.
