# Stitching a visitor to a recognized customer - Prerequisite

## Difference between Visitors & Customers

### Visitor
- Once the user has downloaded the application and the *OptimoveSDK* for Android has run for the first time, the user is considered a *visitor*, i.e., an unidentified visitor
- This visitor id is created by the Optimove SDK for each user who enters your application

### Customer
- Once the user creates an account or log in to the application and recieves your application unique identifier, they becomes customers
- This customer ID (also known as SDK ID) is also your Optimove's customer's unique identifier (e.g email address, or numeric id, or etc)
- All user's visitor data will be stiched to their unique customer ID once recognized

## Important Information   
- This SDK ID is also your Optimove's customer's unique identifier (e.g email address, or numeric id, or etc)
- Your Optimove customer unique identifier is sent to Optimove on the daily customer transfer
- Any SDK ID that does not correspond/match to your Optimove customer unique identifier (Customer ID) due to faulty / unrecognized SDK IDs will not be tracked 
- If you do not know your Optimove customer unique identifier, please contact your Optimove Point of Contact
