# Tracking customers

## When to register a new customer
- Upon user account creation
- Newsletter signup
- Guest checkout

## Stitching visitors to customers
Once the user succesfully creates an account, they become an recognized customer. 
Therefore, as soon as a user creates an accounb to logs into you app (per session), call only one of the functions below:

- `setUserId` method and pass the `SDK ID` when an **"email address" is not** available:
```groovy
// Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known PublicCustomerId
Optimove.getInstance().setUserId("<YOUR_CUSTOMERS_SDK_ID>");
```

- `registerUser` method and pass the `SDK ID` when an **"email address" is** available:
```groovy
// Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known PublicCustomerId
Optimove.getInstance().registerUser("<YOUR_CUSTOMERS_SDK_ID>", "<YOUR_CUSTOMERS_EMAIL_ADDRESS>");
```

> **Note:** No need to wait for the SDK to be fully initialized.

## Encrypting SDK ID
If you will be sending encrypted SDK ID, please follow the steps in [Reporting encrypted CustomerIDs](https://github.com/optimove-tech/Reporting-Encrypted-CustomerID)
