# Tracking Customers

## When to Register a New Customer
- Upon user registration/account creation
- Upon user login
- Upon newsletter signup
- Upon guest checkout

## Associating a Visitor ID a Customer ID
Once the user has succesfully completed one of the above actions, they can become tracked as a recognized customer. 

Use one of the following functions to associate a visitor ID with a customer ID:

- When an **email address is not** available, call the `setUserId` method and pass the `SDK ID`:
```java
// Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known customer id (a.k.a. SDK ID)
Optimove.getInstance().setUserId("<THE_CUSTOMER'S_SDK_ID>");
```

- When an **email address is** available, call the `registerUser` method and pass the `SDK ID`:
```java
// Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known customer id (a.k.a. SDK ID)
Optimove.getInstance().registerUser("<THE_CUSTOMERS_SDK_ID>", "<THE_CUSTOMER'S_EMAIL_ADDRESS>");
```

> **Notes:** 
> - One of the above calls should be made only once per app execution.
> - There is no need to wait for the SDK to be fully initialized before making one of these calls.

## Encrypting SDK ID
If you will be sending the SDK ID encrypted, follow the steps in [Reporting Encrypting Customer IDs](https://github.com/optimove-tech/Reporting-Encrypted-CustomerID).
