# Tracking customers

## Send customer ID to Optimove When

- Upon user account creation / login
- Newsletter signup
- Guest checkout

## Stitching visitors to customers
Once the user successfully creates an account, they become an recognized customer.<br/>
Use one of the following functions accordingly:

- `setUserId` method and pass the `SDK ID` when an **"email address" is not** available:

```java
// Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known customer id (aka SDK ID)
Optimove.getInstance().setUserId("<YOUR_CUSTOMERS_SDK_ID>");
```

- `registerUser` method and pass the `SDK ID` when an **"email address" is** available:

```java
// Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known customer id (aka SDK ID)
Optimove.getInstance().registerUser("<YOUR_CUSTOMERS_SDK_ID>", "<YOUR_CUSTOMERS_EMAIL_ADDRESS>");
```

> **Important Note:** The SDK blocks multiple calls with the same `SDK ID` and/or `Email`, so it's perfectly safe to call `setUserId`/`registerUser` every time the app starts.

## Encrypting SDK ID
If you will be sending encrypted SDK ID, please follow the steps in [Reporting encrypted CustomerIDs](https://github.com/optimove-tech/Reporting-Encrypted-CustomerID)

## Sending emails only to Identified Visitors (none customers)
To send emails to users who are not customers, call the `setUserEmail` method accordingly:
```java
Optimove.getInstance().setUserEmail("<MY_EMAIL>");
```

> **Important Note:** The SDK blocks multiple calls with the same `Email`, so it's perfectly safe to call `setUserEmail` every time the app starts.
