# Tracking customers

## Send customer ID to Optimove When

- Upon user account creation / login
- Newsletter signup
- Guest checkout

## Stitching visitors to customers
Once the user successfully creates an account, they become an recognized customer.<br/>
Use one of the following functions accordingly:

- `setUserId` method and pass the `SDK ID` when an **"email address" is not** available:

```java
// Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known customer id (aka SDK ID)
Optimove.getInstance().setUserId("<YOUR_CUSTOMERS_SDK_ID>");
```

- `registerUser` method and pass the `SDK ID` when an **"email address" is** available:

```java
// Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known customer id (aka SDK ID)
Optimove.getInstance().registerUser("<YOUR_CUSTOMERS_SDK_ID>", "<YOUR_CUSTOMERS_EMAIL_ADDRESS>");
```

> **Important Notes:**
> - No need to wait for the SDK to be fully initialized before calling `setUserId` method
> - The SDK must be fully initialized in order to call the `registerUser` method
> - Either methods can be called once per application lifetime. Calling it more than once will print a warning log message

## Encrypting SDK ID
If you will be sending encrypted SDK ID, please follow the steps in [Reporting encrypted CustomerIDs](https://github.com/optimove-tech/Reporting-Encrypted-CustomerID)

## Sending emails only to Identified Visitors (none customers)
To send emails to users who are not customers, call the `setUserEmail` method accordingly:

```java
@Override
  public void onConfigurationSucceed(SdkRequiredPermission... missingPermissions) {
    Optimove.getInstance().setUserEmail("<MY_EMAIL>");
  }
```
> **Important Notes:**
> - The SDK must be fully initialized in order to call the `setUserEmail` method
> - Calling the `setUserEmail` method is regardless of the `setUserId` method
