# Initializing Optimove Android SDK

## 1. Add Java 8
Add the following to the app module's `build.gradle` file, under the `android` object.

```groovy
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
}
```

## 2. For Kotlin support only
Kotlin is completely interoperable with Java Apps that are written in Kotlin can use the SDK. However, these apps should add the formentioned `compileOptions` in app module's `build.gradle` file and also the following object below:

```groovy
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
}
kotlinOptions {
    jvmTarget = '1.8'
}
```

If you get an error like `:app:transformClassesWithDesugarForDebug`, you may have to enable desugaring in your `gradle.properties` file:
```groovy
android.enableD8.desugaring = true
```

## 3. Add Optimove Repository to Your Project
1. Add the Optimove Maven Repository to your project's root `build.gradle` file the `repositories` object of the `allProjects` object:
    ```groovy
    maven {
      url  "https://mobiussolutionsltd.bintray.com/optimove-sdk"
    }
    ```

2. In your app module's `build.gradle` file, update your dependency statement (under `dependencies` object) to:
    ```groovy
    implementation 'com.optimove.sdk:optimove-sdk:2.+'
    ```

>**Important Note**: 
>Optimove uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), which means that each time you `Sync Now` your `build.gradle`, Optimove SDK will automatically get updated with any minor features, improvements and hotfixes.


## 4. Add Optimove `BuildConfig`
You will receive from Optimove Product Integration team the following details to add to your SDK initialization:<br>
- ***YOUR_OPTIMOVE_TENANT_TOKEN*** – Your unique SDK token in order to identify you from other SDKs
- ***YOUR_OPTIMOVE_CONFIG_NAME*** – The mobile config used to store your app events <br/>
Please see the following two examples if you are using a "staging" and "release" version<br/>

**Staging**
```groovy
android {
    buildTypes {
        stg {
   	    //Note: don't delete the single nor the double quotes - change the value only
	    buildConfigField "String", "OPTIMOVE_TENANT_TOKEN", '"<YOUR_OPTIMOVE_TENANT_TOKEN>"'
	    buildConfigField "String", "OPTIMOVE_CONFIG_NAME", '"<YOUR_OPTIMOVE_CONFIG_NAME>-stg"'

	    //optional - set to "true" during integration
	    buildConfigField "Boolean", "OPTIMOVE_CLIENT_STG_ENV", 'true'	            
	    //optional - set to "DEBUG" during integration
	    buildConfigField "String", "OPTIMOVE_MIN_LOG_LEVEL", '"debug"'
	    }
    }
}
```

**Release**
```groovy
android {
    buildTypes {
        release {
   	    //Note: don't delete the single nor the double quotes - change the value only
	    buildConfigField "String", "OPTIMOVE_TENANT_TOKEN", '"<YOUR_OPTIMOVE_TENANT_TOKEN>"'
	    buildConfigField "String", "OPTIMOVE_CONFIG_NAME", '"<YOUR_OPTIMOVE_CONFIG_NAME>"'

	    buildConfigField "String", "OPTIMOVE_MIN_LOG_LEVEL", '"error"'
	    }
    }
}
```


## 5. Optional: Firebase manual initialization only
This is an optional step if your app uses Firebase and doesn't use the Google Play Services plugin to _automatically_ initialize the app.
    
- **Step1**: Disable Optimove's automatic initialization by setting this to "true":
```groovy
buildConfigField "Boolean", "OPTIMOVE_DISABLE_AUTO_INIT", 'true'
```

Example buildConfig code snippet:
**Release**
```groovy
android {
  buildTypes {
    release {
      buildConfigField "String", "OPTIMOVE_TENANT_TOKEN", '"<YOUR_OPTIMOVE_TENANT_TOKEN>"'
      buildConfigField "String", "OPTIMOVE_CONFIG_NAME", '"<YOUR_OPTIMOVE_CONFIG_NAME>"'

      buildConfigField "String", "OPTIMOVE_MIN_LOG_LEVEL", '"error"'
      // IMPORTANT - Set this to true only if you manually initialize the Firebase SDK
      buildConfigField "Boolean", "OPTIMOVE_DISABLE_AUTO_INIT", 'true'
	  }
  }
}
```
    
- **Step 2**: Manually initialize the Optimove SDK  **after**  it initializes the default  `FirebaseApp` by using the following code snippet:

```java
// Implement this class only if you manually initialize the Firebase SDK (if you don't use the google-service.json file)
public class ManualFirebaseInitApplication extends Application {

  @Override
  public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    // It's crucial that you maintain the following order:
    // First, initialize the Firebase SDK
    FirebaseApp.initializeApp(this);
    // Then, initialize the Optimove SDK
    Optimove.configure(this, new TenantInfo("<YOUR_OPTIMOVE_TENANT_TOKEN>", "<YOUR_OPTIMOVE_CONFIG_NAME>"));
  }
}
```

## 6. Add FirebaseMessagingService
Do this step _only_ if you have FirebaseMessagingService already implemented in your app or in another Push provider's SDK.

When the hosting app also utilizes Firebase Cloud Messaging and implements the `FirebaseMessagingService` (either explicitly or implicitly through another 3rd party SDK) Android's Service Priority kicks in, and Optimove SDK's own `FirebaseMessagingService` is never called. For that reason, the hosting app must call explicitly Optimove's `onMessageReceived` and `onTokenRefresh` callbacks.
The `OptipushMessagingHandler::onMessageReceived` method returns true if the push message was intended for the Optimove SDK.

```java
public class MyMessagingService extends FirebaseMessagingService {

    @Override
    public void onMessageReceived(RemoteMessage remoteMessage) {
      super.onMessageReceived(remoteMessage);
      boolean wasOptipushMessage = new OptipushMessagingHandler(this).onMessageReceived(remoteMessage);
      if (wasOptipushMessage) {
        // You should not attempt to present a notification at this point.
        return;
      }
      // The notification was meant for the App, perform your push logic/forward the remote message to other SDKs here
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onNewToken(String token) {
      super.onNewToken(token);
      // Forward the call to the Optimove SDK
      new OptipushFcmTokenHandler().onTokenRefresh();
      // Continue with the application logic/forward the token to other SDKs
    }
}
```

## 7. Automatic Backup
Starting from Android SDK version `23`, Android offers the Auto Backup for Apps feature as a way to back up and restore the user's data in the app. This is used to prevent corrupted state where the user ID from previous installations won't leak into a new ones.

The Optimove SDK depends on various local files being deleted once the app is uninstalled.
For that reason if the hosting app also defines `android:fullBackupContent="@xml/app_backup_rules"` in the manifest.xml file, Android will raise a merge conflict.

Follow these steps to resolve the conflict and maintain the data integrity of the Optimove SDK:

- Add `tools:replace="android:fullBackupContent">` to the application tag
- Copy the content of the `optimove_backup_rules.xml` to your full-backup-content xml.

## 8. Optional: ProGuard support only

If your app uses [ProGuard](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/shrink-code) add the following to your `proguard-rules.pro`:
```
-keep class <YOUR_PACKAGE_NAME>.BuildConfig { *; }
-keep class com.optimove.sdk.optimove_sdk.main.sdk_configs.** { <fields>; }
```

> If you're using _App Flavours_, please be sure that the fully qualified name of your `BuildConfig` file is set correctly on the first line above.

## 9. Troubleshooting
- **Issue**: The  `build.gradle`  file shows the following error:  _All com.android.support libraries must use the exact same version specification (mixing versions can lead to runtime crashes). Found versions 28.0.0, <X.X.X>._  

- **Solution**: Add an explicit dependency to your  `build.gradle`  file that forces Gradle to resolve the conflict on the V4 support library:  `implementation 'com.android.support:support-v4:28.0.0'`.
