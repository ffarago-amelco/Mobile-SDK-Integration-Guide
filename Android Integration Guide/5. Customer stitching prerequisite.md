# Prerequisites for Associating Users with Customers

## Differences between Visitors and Customers

### Visitor
When a user has downloaded your app and the Optimove Android SDK has run for the first time, the user is considered a *visitor*, i.e., an unidentified user. The Optimove SDK creates a visitor ID for each user who opens your application.

### Customer
- Once users create an account or log in to the app and recieve your app's unique identifier, they become *customers*.
- This customer ID (also known as SDK ID) is also your unique customer identifier in Optimove (e.g., email address, or numeric customer ID).
- Once a user is logged in to the app, all data collected while the user was still a visitor is associated with the customer's unique customer ID.

## Important Information   
- The SDK ID, which is also your unique customer identifier in Optimove, must be the same identifier sent to Optimove during your daily data update.
- Any SDK ID that does not match a unique identifier identifier in Optimove will not be assosicated/tracked.
- If you do not know which field represents the unique customer identifier sent to Optimove, contact the Optimove Product Integration Team for assistance.
