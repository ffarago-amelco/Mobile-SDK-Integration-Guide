# Tracking Android Screen Visits
TODO: Joel we need to change the text to something more simplified and short

To track which screens the user has visited in your app, call the `setScreenVisit` method of the Optimove singleton after the SDK has initialized. 
>**Note**: `setScreenVisit` does allow either:
- The current `Activity`
- A `String` describing the Screen's hierarchy - used for more finely tuned screen hierarchy reporting

TODO: is this correct?
**Current Activity Example**
```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
  
  @Override
  public void onConfigurationSucceed(SdkRequiredPermission... missingPermissions) {

    Optimove.getInstance().setScreenVisit(this, "Main");
  }
}
```

TODO: is this correct?
**Screen's Hierarchy Example**
```java
public class CheckoutFragment extends Fragment {

  @Override
  public void onConfigurationSucceed(SdkRequiredPermission... missingPermissions) {

    Optimove.getInstance().setScreenVisit("Main/Footwear/Boots/ConfirmOrder", "Checkout");
  }
}
```
