# Tracking customers

## Send customer ID to Optimove When:
- Upon user account creation / login
- Newsletter signup
- Guest checkout

## Matching visitors to customers
Once the user succesfully creates an account, they become an recognized customer. 
Use one of the following functions accordingly:

- `setUserId` method and pass the `SDK ID` when an **"email address" is not** available:
```ruby
# Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known customer id (aka SDK ID)
Optimove.shared.setUserId("<MY_SDK_ID>")
```

TODO: Noy was this changed where ID is first and then Email?
- `registerUser` method and pass the `SDK ID` when an **"email address" is** available:
```ruby
# Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known customer id (aka SDK ID)
Optimove.shared.registerUser(email: "<MY_EMAIL>", sdkId: "<MY_SDK_ID>")
```

TODO: Noy Does the SDK need to be fully initalized? Are both below correct>? Any other info needed here?
> **Note:** 
> - No need to wait for the SDK to be fully initialized
> - This should be called once per application lifetime
> - If you will be sending encrypted SDK ID, please follow the steps in [Reporting encrypted CustomerIDs](https://github.com/optimove-tech/Reporting-Encrypted-CustomerID)


## Sending emails only to Identified Visitors (none customers)
TODO: Noy is this correct?
To track a userâ€™s email address without stitching them to a customer in order to send them email notifications, call the `setUserEmail` method to record the address.

```ruby
# Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known email address. Can be called regardless of the "setUserId" call.
Optimove.shared.setUserEmail(email: "<MY_EMAIL>");
```
