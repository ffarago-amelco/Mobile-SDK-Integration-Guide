# Tracking customers

## Send customer ID to Optimove When

- Upon user account creation / login
- Newsletter signup
- Guest checkout

## Matching visitors to customers

Once the user successfully creates an account, they become an recognized customer.
Use one of the following functions accordingly:

- `setUserId` method and pass the `SDK ID` when an **"email address" is not** available:

```swift
// Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known customer id (aka SDK ID)
Optimove.shared.setUserId("<MY_SDK_ID>")
```

- `registerUser` method and pass the `SDK ID` when an **"email address" is** available:

```swift
func optimove(_ optimove: Optimove, didBecomeActiveWithMissingPermissions missingPermissions: [OptimoveDeviceRequirement]) {
    // Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known customer id (aka SDK ID)
    Optimove.shared.registerUser(sdkId: "<MY_SDK_ID>", email: "<MY_EMAIL>")
}
```

> - No need to wait for the SDK to be fully initialized before calling `setUserId` but do wait before calling the `registerUser` method
> - Either methods can be called once per application lifetime. Calling it more than once will print a warning log message.
> - If you will be sending encrypted SDK ID, please follow the steps in [Reporting encrypted CustomerIDs](https://github.com/optimove-tech/Reporting-Encrypted-CustomerID)

## Sending emails only to Identified Visitors (none customers)

To track a userâ€™s email address without stitching them to a customer in order to send them email notifications, call the `setUserEmail` method to record the address.

```swift
func optimove(_ optimove: Optimove, didBecomeActiveWithMissingPermissions missingPermissions: [OptimoveDeviceRequirement]) {
    // Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known email address. Can be called regardless of the "setUserId" call.
    Optimove.shared.setUserEmail(email: "<MY_EMAIL>");
}
```
