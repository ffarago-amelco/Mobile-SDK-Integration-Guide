# Tracking customers

## Send customer ID to Optimove When

- Upon user account creation / login
- Newsletter signup
- Guest checkout

## Stitching visitors to customers

Once the user successfully creates an account, they become an recognized customer.  
Use one of the following functions accordingly:

- `setUserId` method and pass the `SDK ID` when an **"email address" is not** available:

```swift
// Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known customer id (aka SDK ID)
Optimove.shared.setUserId("<MY_SDK_ID>")
```

- `registerUser` method and pass the `SDK ID` when an **"email address" is** available:

```swift
// Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known customer id (aka SDK ID)
Optimove.shared.registerUser(sdkId: "<MY_SDK_ID>", email: "<MY_EMAIL>")
```

> **Important Note:** The SDK blocks multiple calls with the same `SDK ID` and/or `Email`, so it's perfectly safe to call `setUserId`/`registerUser` every time the app starts.

## Encrypting SDK ID

If you will be sending encrypted SDK ID, please follow the steps in [Reporting encrypted CustomerIDs](https://github.com/optimove-tech/Reporting-Encrypted-CustomerID)

## Sending emails only to Identified Visitors (none customers)

To send emails to users who are not customers, call the `setUserEmail` method accordingly:

```swift
// Call to notify the SDK that the user has a known email address.
Optimove.shared.setUserEmail(email: "<MY_EMAIL>")
```

> **Important Note:** The SDK blocks multiple calls with the same `Email`, so it's perfectly safe to call `setUserEmail` every time the app starts.
