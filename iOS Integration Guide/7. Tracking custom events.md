# Tracking custom events

Once you and the Optimove Product Integration Team have reviewed your use cases, you will define the custom events together. The Product Integration Team will configure your particular events and parameters within your Optimove site, while you will be responsible for passing the event and parameter information to Optimove.

## Custom Event Notes
- Custom events must be first configured by Optimove Product Integration team before  implementation
- Events and parameters must be in lowercase and use snake_case naming convention only
- - **snake_case** definition: Separate each word with one underscore character (_) and no spaces. (e.g., checkout_completed)
- The parameter types available for use in event reporting functions are:
- - **String**: A series of alphanumeric characters of up to 255 characters in length, using any encoding
- - **Number**: Any numeric value, whether an integer or a value containing a decimal point
- - **Boolean**: Is either "true" or "false" values, not a string
- Optimove supports up to 50 parameters per custom event

## Structure and protocol
TODO: Is this correct and i need an example of the strucutre

Use the following function to report a simple event:<br/>`Optimove.sharedInstance.reportEvent(event: MyCustomEvent())`.
- `name: String` – Required string value of the exact event name configured by the Product Integration Team
- `parameters: [String:Any]` – Optional value of the exact parameter name(s) configured by the Product Integration Team

>- The `reportEvent(event:)` method should only be called after the initialization success callback was received.


**Code Snippet Example**
TODO: Please show a real example of cart details (same as we did in android)
```swift
class MyCustomEvent: OptimoveEvent
{
    var name: String
    var parameters: [String:Any]
    
    init(name: String, parameters: [String:Any])
    {
        self.name = name
        self.parameters = parameters
    }
}
```

Then send that event through the `reportEvent(event:)` method of the `Optimove` singleton.
  
```swift
override func viewDidAppear(_ animated: Bool) {
	super.viewDidAppear(animated)
	Optimove.sharedInstance.reportEvent(event: MyCustomEvent())
}
```
