# Managing iOS Environments
Optimove supports multiple application environments to allow you to send your SDK log details to Optimove during integration phase.

## Enabling Staging Environment
You will require to a flag to mark the specific `Build Configuration`s in order to represent the app's _Staging_ environment. This flag is added to your App Target's **Build Setting** as follows:

1. Click the plus icon on the top bar and click **Add User-Defined Setting**:

2. Set the setting's name to `OPTIMOVE_CLIENT_STG_ENV` under `User-Defined`
3. For the appropriate `Build Configuration` (e.g Debug) set the value to `true`, while the rest (e.g. Release) should be `false`. For example:

4. Add an entry to your App's `Info.plist` file with the key `OPTIMOVE_CLIENT_STG_ENV` and the value that is determined during build time to match your app's build settings: `$(OPTIMOVE_CLIENT_STG_ENV)`. For example:

> The SDK considers a _Staging_ environment as follows:
> - Safe to collect more metrics about the SDK's performance, disregarding battery/data use conservation
> - This should only be enabled for `Build Configuration`s that are in _Staging_ which is the `Build Configuration` you are sharing with Optimove Product Integration team during integration (and not your development environment)

## Configurating Log Levels
Use this during your development/testing stages.
By default we will report any log from INFO level and above, except for when the app is in production, where we set it to WARN and above. With this feature they can optionally change the levels to ones they see fit to their environments. This should really only be in use for apps that care about controlling these sort of things

- Optimove supports log levels by adding the optional flag  `OPTIMOVE_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` in the app target's **Build Settings** page and `Info.plist` file in the same manner that the `OPTIMOVE_CLIENT_STG_ENV` flag was added.
- Possible values are:  _debug/warn/error_ (case insenstive)
