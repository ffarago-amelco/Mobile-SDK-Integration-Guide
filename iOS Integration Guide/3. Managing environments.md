# Managing iOS Environments

Optimove supports multiple application environments to allow you to send your SDK log details to Optimove during integration phase.

## Enabling Staging Environment

You will require to a flag to mark the specific `Build Configuration`s in order to represent the app's _Staging_ environment. This flag is added to your App Target's **Build Setting** as follows:

1. Click the plus icon on the top bar and click **Add User-Defined Setting**:

2. Set the setting's name to `OPTIMOVE_CLIENT_STG_ENV` under `User-Defined`
3. For the appropriate `Build Configuration` (e.g Debug) set the value to `true`, while the rest (e.g. Release) should be `false`. For example:

4. Add an entry to your App's `Info.plist` file with the key `OPTIMOVE_CLIENT_STG_ENV` and the value that is determined during build time to match your app's build settings: `$(OPTIMOVE_CLIENT_STG_ENV)`. For example:

> The SDK considers a _Staging_ environment as follows:
>
> - Safe to collect more metrics about the SDK's performance, disregarding battery/data use conservation
> - This should only be enabled for `Build Configuration`s that are in _Staging_ which is the `Build Configuration` you are sharing with Optimove Product Integration team during integration (and not your development environment)
