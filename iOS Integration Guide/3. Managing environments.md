## Enabling Staging Environment

Optimove has added the ability to manage multiple application environments and send your SDK log details to Optimove during integration phase.

Added a flag to mark the specific `Build Configuration`s that represent the app's _Staging_ environment. The flag is added to your App Target's **Build Setting**:

1. Click the plus icon on the top bar and click **Add User-Defined Setting**:

2. Set the setting's name to `OPTIMOVE_CLIENT_STG_ENV`.
3. For the appropriate `Build Configuration` set the value to `true`. The rest should be `false`. For example:

> The SDK considers a _Staging_ environment one that is:
> - Safe to collect more metrics about the SDK's performance, disregarding battery/data use conservation
> - This should only be enabled for `Build Configuration`s that are in _Staging_ and not your development environment

## Configurating Log Levels

Use this during your development/testing stages.
By default we will report any log from INFO level and above, except for when the app is in production, where we set it to WARN and above. With this feature they can optionally change the levels to ones they see fit to their environments. This should really only be in use for apps that care about controlling these sort of things

- Optimove supports log levels by adding the optional flag  `OPTIMOVE_MIN_LOG_LEVEL` in the app target's **Build Settings** page in the same manner that the `OPTIMOVE_CLIENT_STG_ENV` flag was added.
- Possible values are:  _debug/warn/error_ (case insenstive)
