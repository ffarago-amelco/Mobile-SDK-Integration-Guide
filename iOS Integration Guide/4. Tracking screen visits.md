# Tracking Screen Visits

To track which screens the user has visited in your app, call one of the overloads of `setScreenVisit` methods of the Optimove singleton after the SDK has been successfully initialized:

- ```swift 
    Optimove.shared.setScreenVisit(
        screenPath: String, 
        screenTitle: String,
        screenCategory: String?
    )
  
- ```swift
    Optimove.shared.setScreenVisit(
        screenPath: [String],
        screenTitle: String,
        screenCategory: String?
    )

Where:

- **screenPath**: which represent the path to the current screen in the form of 'path/to/scene
- **screenTitle**: which represent the current scene
- **screenCategory**: which adds the scene category it belongs to. 

**Simple screen path snippet example**:

```swift
func optimove(_ optimove: Optimove, didBecomeActiveWithMissingPermissions missingPermissions: [OptimoveDeviceRequirement]) {
    Optimove.shared.setScreenVisit(
        screenPath: "Home/Store/Footwear/Boots",
        screenTitle: "<YOUR_TITLE>",
        screenCategory: "<OPTIONAL: YOUR_CATEGORY>"
    )
}
```

**Array of screen titles as path code snippet example**:
Added a screen reporting function which takes an array of screen titles instead of a screenPath String:

```swift
func optimove(_ optimove: Optimove, didBecomeActiveWithMissingPermissions missingPermissions: [OptimoveDeviceRequirement]) {
    Optimove.shared.setScreenVisit(
        screenPathArray: ["Home", "Store", "Footwear", "Boots"],
        screenTitle: "<YOUR_TITLE>",
        screenCategory: "<OPTIONAL: YOUR_CATEGORY>"
    )
}
```

> Remember to always call the Optimove SDK after the `optimove(_: didBecomeActiveWithMissingPermissions:)` callback is called
