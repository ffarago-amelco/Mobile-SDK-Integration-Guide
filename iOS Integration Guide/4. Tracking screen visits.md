# Tracking Screen Visits
To track which screens the user has visited in your app, call one of the overloads of `setScreenVisit` methods of the Optimove singleton after the SDK has been successfully initialized:

```swift 
    Optimove.shared.setScreenVisit(screenPath: String, screenTitle: String, screenCategory: String?)
```

```swift
    Optimove.shared.setScreenVisit(screenPath: [String], screenTitle: String, screenCategory: String?)
```

> - **screenPath**: which represent the path to the current screen in the form of 'path/to/scene
> - **screenTitle**: which represent the current scene
> - **screenCategory**: which adds the scene category it belongs to. 

### Simple screen path snippet example:
To report a single screen title:

```swift
func optimove(_ optimove: Optimove, didBecomeActiveWithMissingPermissions missingPermissions: [OptimoveDeviceRequirement]) {
    Optimove.shared.setScreenVisit(
        screenPath: "Home/Store/Footwear/Boots",
        screenTitle: "<YOUR_TITLE>",
        screenCategory: "<OPTIONAL: YOUR_CATEGORY>"
    )
}
```

### Array of screen titles code snippet example:
To report an array of screen titles instead of a screenPath String:

```swift
func optimove(_ optimove: Optimove, didBecomeActiveWithMissingPermissions missingPermissions: [OptimoveDeviceRequirement]) {
    Optimove.shared.setScreenVisit(
        screenPathArray: ["Home", "Store", "Footwear", "Boots"],
        screenTitle: "<YOUR_TITLE>",
        screenCategory: "<OPTIONAL: YOUR_CATEGORY>"
    )
}
```

> **Important Note:** Always call the Optimove SDK after the `optimove(_: didBecomeActiveWithMissingPermissions:)` callback is called.
