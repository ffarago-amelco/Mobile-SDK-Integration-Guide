# Tracking Screen Visits

To track which screens the user has visited in your app, call one of the overloads of `setScreenVisit` methods of the Optimove singleton after the SDK has been successfully initialized:

```swift
    Optimove.shared.setScreenVisit(screenPath: String, screenTitle: String, screenCategory: String?)
```

```swift
    Optimove.shared.setScreenVisit(screenPath: [String], screenTitle: String, screenCategory: String?)
```

> - **screenPath**: Represent the path to the current screen in the form of 'path/to/scene
> - **screenTitle**: Represent the current scene
> - **screenCategory**: (Optional) Adds the scene category it belongs to

## Simple screen path snippet example

To report a single screen title:

```swift
Optimove.shared.setScreenVisit(
        screenPath: "Home/Store/Footwear/Boots",
        screenTitle: "<YOUR_TITLE>",
        screenCategory: "<OPTIONAL: YOUR_CATEGORY>"
    )
```

## Array of screen titles code snippet example

To report an array of screen titles instead of a screenPath String:

```swift
    Optimove.shared.setScreenVisit(
        screenPathArray: ["Home", "Store", "Footwear", "Boots"],
        screenTitle: "<YOUR_TITLE>",
        screenCategory: "<OPTIONAL: YOUR_CATEGORY>"
    )
```
