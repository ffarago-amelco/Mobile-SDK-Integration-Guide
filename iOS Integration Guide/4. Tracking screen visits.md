# Tracking Screen Visits
To track which screens the user has visited in your app, call one of the overloads of `setScreenVisit` methods of the Optimove singleton after the SDK has successfully initialized:

- ```swift 
    Optimove.shared.setScreenVisit(
        screenPath: String, 
        screenTitle: String,
        screenCategory: String?
    )
  
- ```swift
    Optimove.shared.setScreenVisit(
        screenPath: [String], 
        screenTitle: String, 
        screenCategory: String?
    )

Where:
- **screenPath**: which represent the path to the current screen in the form of 'path/to/scene
- **screenTitle**: which represent the current scene
- **screenCategory**: which adds the scene category it belongs to. 

TODO: Can we write something similiar for iOS? - No I think we can just delete this one
Calling one of the overloads with the `Activity` parameter means that the SDK would build your screen's path according to the `Activity`'s hierarchy. Alternatively, you can control that hierarchy yourself by calling one of the `String screenPath` overloads (for example, if you use `Fragment`s for app navigation).

**Single screen title code snippet example**
TODO: Should it be in some function? Where do we mention it must be after initalization?
```swift
Optimove.shared.setScreenVisit(
    screenPath: "<YOUR_PATH>", 
    screenTitle: "<YOUR_TITLE>", 
    screenCategory: "<OPTIONAL: YOUR_CATEGORY>"
)
```

**Array of screen titles code snippet example**
Added a screen reporting function which takes an array of screen titles instead of a screenPath String: 
TODO: Should it be in some function? Where do we mention it must be after initalization?
```swift
Optimove.shared.setScreenVisit(
    screenPathArray: ["Home", "Store", "Footware", "Boots"], 
    screenTitle: "<YOUR_TITLE>", 
    screenCategory: "<OPTIONAL: YOUR_CATEGORY>"
)
```
