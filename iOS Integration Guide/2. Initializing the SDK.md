# Initializing Optimove iOS SDK

## 1. Download the Optimove SDK

1. If you haven't already, add [Cocoapods](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html) to your project:
   1. Close your _XCode_ project
   2. Open Terminal on your project's **root** folder.
   3. Run `pod init`
   4. Cocoapods will generate a **_Workspace_** file `*.xcworkspace` - use it from now on.
2. Open your `Podfile`
3. Locate your App's `target` declaration
4. Add the `OptimoveSDK` to the target's dependencies list: `pod 'OptimoveSDK', '~> 2.0'`

`Podfile` code snippet:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
# Update "target" accordingly to support silent minor upgrades:
target '<YOUR_TARGET_NAME>' do
    use_frameworks!
    pod 'OptimoveSDK', '~> 2.0'
end
```

> **Important Note**: Use the `~>` operator to seamlessly get the latest, backwards-compatible, Optimove SDK. Every time you'd run `pod update` you'll get the latest stable version because the `OptimoveSDK` follows semantic versioning.

## 2. Adding Optimove SDK Details
You will receive from Optimove Product Integration team the following details to add to your SDK initialization:

- ***YOUR_OPTIMOVE_TENANT_TOKEN*** – Your unique SDK token in order to identify you from other SDKs
- ***YOUR_OPTIMOVE_CONFIG_NAME*** – The mobile config used to store your app events

Call the SDK's initialization function from your `AppDelegate`'s `func application()` callback. See code example below:

```swift
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        let info = OptimoveTenantInfo(tenantToken: "<YOUR_TENANT_TOKEN>",configName:"<YOUR_CONFIG_NAME>")
        Optimove.configure(for: info)
    }

}
```

## 3. Optional: Firebase manual initialization only
If you already using the Firebase SDK, add our `FirebaseApp.configure()` to...
TODO: @noy please finish the sentence on line 47 as it doesn'te explain why.
Note: Failing to add this function when you are already using your own Firebase SDK will cause unexpected behavior, as well as crashes.

See code snippet example below:

```swift
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        //Add this "before" Optimove.configure(for: info) - a must 
        FirebaseApp.configure()
        let info = OptimoveTenantInfo(tenantToken: "<MY_TENANT_TOKEN>",configName:"<MY_CONFIG_NAME>")
        Optimove.configure(for: info)
    }

}
```

## 4. AppDelegate Callbacks Forwarding
In order to forward the AppDelegate Callbacks, inside your `AppDelegate` class, locate/implement the following callbacks accordingly:

See code snippet example below:

```swift
func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                    didReceiveRemoteNotification userInfo: [AnyHashable: Any],
                    fetchCompletionHandler completionHandler: @escaping (UIBackgroundFetchResult) -> Void) {
    let isHandledByOptimove = Optimove.shared.didReceiveRemoteNotification(userInfo: userInfo, didComplete: completionHandler)
    if isHandledByOptimove { return }
    // The remote notification didn't originate from Optimove's servers, so the app must handle it. Below is the default implementation
    completionHandler(.noData)
}

func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                    didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken deviceToken: Data) {
    Optimove.shared.application(didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken: deviceToken)
}
```

## 5. Setting up Capabilities
To setup Capabilities, open the **Capabilities** page for your Application's App Target as follows:

1. Enable the `Push Notifications` capability
2. Enable the `Remote Notifications` capability in `Background Modes`
3. Enable the `App Groups` capability. Then add the following group: `group.<YOUR_APP_BUNDLE_ID>.optimove`

## 6. Defining SDK state
The SDK initialization process occurs asynchronously, off the `Main UI Thread`.
Before calling the Public API methods, make sure that the SDK has finished initialization by calling the `registerSuccessStateListener` function within the the `OptimoveSuccessStateListener` instance.

See code snippet example below:

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, OptimoveSuccessStateListener {

    /**  **Important Note**
    If the object implementing the `OptimoveSuccessStateListener` is a component
    with a _"Lifecycle"_ (i.e. `ViewController`), **_always_** unregister that object
    when it needs to clear memory use (e.g. `viewWillDisappear`)
    **/

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        Optimove.shared.registerSuccessStateListener(self)
    }

    override func viewWillDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewWillDisappear(animated)
        Optimove.shared.unregisterSuccessStateListener(self)
    }

    func optimove(_ optimove: Optimove, didBecomeActiveWithMissingPermissions missingPermissions: [OptimoveDeviceRequirement]) {
        //You can now start calling Optimove SDK functions (e.g. screenVisits)
    }

}
```

## 7. Permissions
Once the SDK has finished initializing successfully, it passes all **User Dependent missing permissions** through the `optimove(_:didBecomeActiveWithMissingPermissions:)`. <br/>
> **Important Note**: These permissions are important to the _user experience_ and do not block the SDK's proper operation.

See Permissions below:

- `NOTIFICATIONS` - Indicates that the user has opted-out from the app's notification
- `ADVERTISING_ID` - Indicates that the user has opted-out from allowing apps from accessing his/her **Advertising ID**

## 8. Troubleshooting

1. If your project is an Objective-C project, open your app's **Build Settings** page:
- Check if there's an entry for `LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS`
- If there is make sure that the value is set to `$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift/$(PLATFORM_NAME)`
- If there isn't, set the value to: `$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift/$(PLATFORM_NAME)`
