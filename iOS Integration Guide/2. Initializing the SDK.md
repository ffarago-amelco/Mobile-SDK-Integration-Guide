# Initializing Optimove iOS SDK

Please follow the step by step below.

## 1. Download the Optimove SDK

The below will allow any newer minor version of `OptimoveSDK` not to break the existing API (i.e 2._._) and will be auto-fetched during any `pod update`. OptimoveSDK uses __semantic versioning__. Therefore, in your `Podfile` set the pod version with the `~>` sign.

Example code snippet:

```ruby
platform :ios, '10.0'
# Update "target" accordingly to support silent minor upgrades:
target '<YOUR_TARGET_NAME>' do
    use_frameworks!
    pod 'OptimoveSDK', '~> 2.0'
end

target 'Notification Extension' do
    use_frameworks!
    pod 'OptimoveNotificationServiceExtension','~> 2.0'
end
```

## 2. Adding Optimove SDK Details

TODO: Sit with Noy about this entire step

You will receive from Optimove Product Integration team the following details to add to your SDK initialization:

- ***YOUR_OPTIMOVE_TENANT_TOKEN*** – Your unique SDK token in order to identify you from other SDKs
- ***YOUR_OPTIMOVE_CONFIG_NAME*** – The mobile config used to store your app events

Call the SDK's initialization function from your `AppDelegate`'s `func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool` callback:

```swift
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        let info = OptimoveTenantInfo(tenantToken: "<MY_TENANT_TOKEN>",configName:"<MY_CONFIG_NAME>")
        Optimove.configure(for: info)
    }
}
```

> **Important Note**: If you use the Firebase SDK, add `FirebaseApp.configure()` before `Optimove.configure(for: info)`. Failing to do so when you use the Firebase SDK will cause unexpected behavior and even crashes. Example:

```swift
class AppDelegate: UIResponder, UIApplicationDelegate {

    func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplicationLaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
        FirebaseApp.configure()
        let info = OptimoveTenantInfo(tenantToken: "<MY_TENANT_TOKEN>",configName:"<MY_CONFIG_NAME>")
        Optimove.configure(for: info)
    }
}
```

## 4. Setting up Capabilities

Open the **Capabilities** page for your Application's App Target:

1. Enable the `Push Notifications` capability
2. Enable the `Remote Notifications` capability in `Background Modes`
3. Enable the `App Groups` capability. Then add the following group: `group.<YOUR_APP_BUNDLE_ID>.optimove`

## 5. Defining SDK state

The SDK initialization process occurs asynchronously, off the `Main UI Thread`.
Before calling the Public API methods, make sure that the SDK has finished initialization by calling the `registerSuccessStateListener` function within the the `OptimoveSuccessStateListener` instance.

```swift
class ViewController: UIViewController, OptimoveSuccessStateListener {

    /**  **Important Note**
    If the object implementing the `OptimoveSuccessStateListener` is a component
    with a _"Lifecycle"_ (i.e. `ViewController`), **_always_** unregister that object
    when it needs to clear memory use (e.g. `viewWillDisappear`)
    **/

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        Optimove.shared.registerSuccessStateListener(self)
    }

    override func viewWillDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {
        super.viewWillDisappear(animated)
        Optimove.shared.unregisterSuccessStateListener(self)
    }

    func optimove(_ optimove: Optimove, didBecomeActiveWithMissingPermissions missingPermissions: [OptimoveDeviceRequirement]) {
        //You can now start calling Optimove SDK functions (e.g. screenVisits)
    }
}
```

## 6. Permissions

Once the SDK has finished initializing successfully, it passes all **User Dependent missing permissions** through the `optimove(_:didBecomeActiveWithMissingPermissions:)`. These permissions are important to the _user experience_ but do not block the SDK's proper operation.

These Permission are:

- `NOTIFICATIONS` - Indicates that the user has opted-out from the app's notification
- `ADVERTISING_ID` - Indicates that the user has opted-out from allowing apps from accessing his/her **Advertising ID**

TODO: What about different bundles like staging / prod? - they just need to send them to us, should be specified in the prereqs - Meytal Yes
TODO: Forward Firebase Tokens to Optimove? - Meytal no need

## Import Installation Notes

1. If your project is an Objective-C project, open your app's **Build Settings** page:
    1. Check if there's an entry for `LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS`
    2. If there is make sure that the value is set to `$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift/$(PLATFORM_NAME)`
    3. If there isn't, set the value to: `$(TOOLCHAIN_DIR)/usr/lib/swift/$(PLATFORM_NAME)`
