# Submitting to the App Store

The Optimove SDK collects the user's IDFA (IDentifier For Advertisers). Our implementation complies with the usage limitations of the Advertising Identifier and the Limited Ad Tracking settings.
As the owner of the submitted app, you must acknowledge that you know that the version you submit collects this identifier and follows all the needed guidelines.
During the submission process, please tick the following checkboxes:

* _Attribute this app installation to a previously served advertisement_
* _Attribute an action taken within this app to a previously served advertisement_
* _I, <YOUR_NAME>, confirm that this app, and any third partyâ€¦_

**Do not** tick the checkbox that says _Serve advertisements within the app_ unless you actually intend to serve ads.
